# Areba Project
This repository contains assignments from Project 2, demonstrating my understanding of key Oracle EBS modules, including Order Management, General Ledger, Inventory, Procurement (P2P and B2B), and Payment modules.
Each assignment showcases insights into the functionality, workflows, and practical applications of these modules in enterprise resource planning and financial operations.
